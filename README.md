# Network-Traffic-Classifier
Internet network classifier using Naive bayes
Accurate traffic classification is of fundamental importance to numerous other network
activities, from security monitoring to accounting, and from Quality of Service to providing
operators with useful forecasts for long-term provisioning. We apply a Naive Bayes
estimator to categorize traffic by application. Uniquely, our work capitalizes on
pre-classified network data, using it as input to a supervised Naive Bayes estimator. In this
report, we illustrate the high level of accuracy achievable with the Naive Bayes estimator.
We further illustrate the improved accuracy obtained from this estimator where we have
used Recursive feature elimination and Majority voting classifiers to increase the speed and
performance of a classifier.
